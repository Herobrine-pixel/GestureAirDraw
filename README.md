# GestureAirDraw
GestureAirDraw is an Arduino library that lets you draw in the air using an IMU (MPU6050 / MPU9250). The library computes pitch/roll using a complementary filter, maps orientation to 2D coordinates, records strokes, and exports SVG polylines over Serial or to an SD card (optional).
